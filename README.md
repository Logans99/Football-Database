# Football-Database
The purpose of this database is to track American football players, games, coaches, team organizations, and the interactions between them with multiple teams in mind. 

The overall goal of this database is to be able to analyze football games being played by a home team and away team on a specific date while also tracking the head coach of each player and the organization/team the player is a part of. We want to be able to look into what teams are scheduled for a game and if players are scheduled to play in that game or not play. 

The logic for this database is as follows. Games are pre-scheduled and each player may or may not play in a game. We know this player's team, coach, position, contract length, salary, what games they intend to play in, etc. We also know what teams will go head to head and if itâ€™s a home team or an away team.
